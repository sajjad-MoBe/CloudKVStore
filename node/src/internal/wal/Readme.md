# Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Package Analysis

This package implements a Write-Ahead Log system, which is a critical component for data durability in database systems. Let me break down the components and their functionality:

## Core Components

### 1. Basic WAL Implementation (`FileWAL`)

The `FileWAL` struct provides the fundamental WAL functionality:
- **WALEntry**: Represents a single log entry with operation type (SET/DELETE), key, value, and timestamp
- **FileWAL**: Implements the basic file-based WAL operations:
    - `Append()`: Adds new entries to the log
    - `Sync()`: Ensures data is written to disk
    - `Close()`: Properly closes the log file
- Uses Go's `gob` package for efficient binary serialization
- Implements thread safety with a mutex
- Supports synchronous writes (syncMode) for stronger durability guarantees

### 2. Advanced WAL Management (`WALManager`)

The `WALManager` builds on the basic functionality with more sophisticated features:

#### Key Features:
- **File Rotation**: Automatically creates new WAL files when they reach a configured size
- **Retention Policy**: Maintains a maximum number of WAL files, cleaning up old ones
- **Periodic Rotation**: Rotates files at regular intervals regardless of size
- **Metrics Collection**: Tracks operational statistics
- **Recovery System**: Can replay all WAL entries to restore state

#### Implementation Details:
- Uses a directory-based approach with timestamped filenames (e.g., `wal-20230101120000.log`)
- Manages concurrent access with read-write mutex
- Implements background goroutines for periodic rotation
- Provides cleanup of old files based on retention policy
- Supports recovery by replaying all WAL files in order

## Use Cases

This WAL system would be used in scenarios like:
1. Database systems needing crash recovery
2. Key-value stores requiring durability
3. Any application needing to persist state changes before applying them

## Benefits

1. **Durability**: Ensures operations are logged before being applied
2. **Crash Recovery**: Can reconstruct state by replaying the log
3. **Performance**: Sequential writes are faster than random disk access
4. **Flexibility**: Configurable rotation and retention policies
5. **Observability**: Built-in metrics collection

The implementation shows a progression from a simple single-file WAL to a more sophisticated managed solution with rotation, retention, and recovery capabilities.
